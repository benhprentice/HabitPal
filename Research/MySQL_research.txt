MySQL is an open-source relational database managament system. MySQL uses tables to store data. Every row in the table is an entry and every column is a type. Tables can be related to each other. The user can get data from one table and use that data to retrieve related data from another table. Organizing data this way can make the tables more understandable. It can also eliminate the need for a lot of duplicate data. MySQL can be implemented into a Python/Flask server. Building tables is quite simple and the syntax is easy to understand and code.
