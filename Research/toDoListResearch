With researching the implementation process for a task manager list,
it has become clear that Javascript will be the best means to accomplish this.
HTML and CSS will be used for styling and presentation of course, but the best way to 
go about this with time constraints in mind is to promptly either 
find an existing repository and edit it to my liking, or create one from scratch to ensure
that it can go according to plan. 
There will need to be a listener or such to ensure
that a tasks completion goes towards the virtual pet's status wether directly or indirectly. 
This seems to be done best by adding it to the click listener that happens when a task
is checked off and changed to completed. This will need to stay, even when the completed task is
deleted from the list of existing things left. I will discuss with my team members how they want
to go about unchecking a previously completed task.
Local storage will be important, because this ensures that when the webpage is refreshed, progress
won't be lost. This is a temporary implementation for development sake, as the final product will
have database functionality. Good UI is important, so aesthetics will include contrasting text 
from background color, sans serif font, a clear indication of buttons and their functionalities
that users are used to, and maybe a light and dark mode in late stage development. In addition,
it is essential to know wether implementing this funtion below tha avatar or on a different tab 
entirely is important.
