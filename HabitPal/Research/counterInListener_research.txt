The purpose of this research is to understand the best way
to add a counter of sorts to the click listener so that, when a 
task is completed, the counter can increment and affect the 
sprite of our virtual pet. Thankfully, this is more straightforward than 
I was previously concerned on. This can be done in two ways: attaching the counter
to the same listener that is in place for completing the task, or counting the completed
tasks that are in local storage.
