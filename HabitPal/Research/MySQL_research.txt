MySQL is an open-source relational database managament system. MySQL 
uses tables to store data. Every row in the table is an entry and every 
column is a type. Tables can be related to each other. The user can get 
data from one table and use that data to retrieve related data from 
another table. Organizing data this way can make the tables more 
understandable. It can also eliminate the need for a lot of duplicate 
data. MySQL can be implemented into a Python/Flask server. Building 
tables is quite simple and the syntax is easy to understand and code.
